### TASK

José María is not very familiar with statistics however he knows the concept of statistical significance. He writes to you another e-mail:
*Hi, Thanks for the numbers. 
Just one doubt: is the difference* [referring to revenue and ticket] *between France and Italy meaningful? 
Let me know. 
Best. 
JM.*

### Assumptions

- Only considered transactions with status = 1
- Transaction with no amount populated discarted
- Transactions with positive refunds discarted
- Transaction amounts in € (euros)

### KPI's
 
 

| Country    | France  | Italy  |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
|Gross Revenue     | €82,671.09   | €96,123.99 |
|Net Revenue     | €65,814.77   | €77,010.28 |
|Number of transactions     | €3,081.00   | €3,735.00 |
|Ticket value     | €26.83   | €25.74 |

##### Ticket value per country

France has a 12% higher Ticket value then Italy.

Running a z-test of two means, the probabily of the null hypothesis being true is around 2,3%, which is considerer extremely rare. For that reason we can assume the null hypothesis is not true and so, that the difference between the two samples is meaningful. 

**Indeed the the difference in Ticket regarding both countries is a meaninful.**
